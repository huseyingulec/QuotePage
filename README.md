# Inspirational Quote Page
Live-demo -> https://insquotepage.netlify.app/

## What I have done;
In this project, I have tried to build a inspirational quote page. I have tried to use subjects that I have learnt from the course until now. The subjects I used are classes, background image, google fonts, flexbox, hover and putting a link to the container to open in the new tab. 
I have been trying to challenge myself as much as possible to learn faster because I am aware that fastest way to learn code is writing code.
